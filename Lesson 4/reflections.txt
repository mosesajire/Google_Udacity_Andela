My Answers:

1. I have learned how to do more research on HTML elements, and get the result that I want to see. I have also learned that <s>, <sup> and <hr> stand for strikethrough, superscript and horizontal rule respectively.

2. The lessons have been very explanatory and easy to understand. Hence, I have been finding it easy to apply what I have learned. 

3. Nothing has been difficult. The project is not difficult because all the tags that have been learned can easily be implemented in it.

4. I have used the problem solving strategies to find out and learn more about HTML tags that are relevant to what I am working on. The search functionality on the MDN element reference has been very helpful.
